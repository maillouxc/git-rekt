# git-rekt
Group project for FGCU's intro to Software Engineering. A resort management/booking desktop application.

If you are reading this README from a local file, the github repository where it is contained is at
https://github.com/maillouxc/git-rekt

The file is in markdown format, and may be easier to read there.

## Build Instructions:

Minimum Java 8 required.

1. Using the command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. Run the command `gradlew build` (`./gradlew build` if using mac/linux or any bash shell) (This may take a minute)

3. Using the file explorer, navigate to build/libs and run the generated jar file.

(You could also use the command `gradlew run` but this requires keeping the cmd prompt open)

The project site with more information and links to the other deliverables (including the user manual) is located at 
https://sites.google.com/view/git-rekt-resort/the-team

Any bugs found can be submitted to the github issues tracker.

Note that the software has some quirks; details are available on the project website and in the user manual.

You can also download a fully built JAR file on the "releases" page of the repository and just run that.

The file is in markdown format, and may be easier to read there.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

Minimum Java 8 required.

1. Using the command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. Run the command `gradlew build` (`./gradlew build` if using mac/linux or any bash shell) (This may take a minute)

3. Using the file explorer, navigate to build/libs and run the generated jar file.

(You could also use the command `gradlew run` but this requires keeping the cmd prompt open)

The project site with more information and links to the other deliverables (including the user manual) is located at

Any bugs found can be submitted to the github issues tracker.

Note that the software has some quirks; details are available on the project website and in the user manual.

You can also download a fully built JAR file on the "releases" page of the repository and just run that.
